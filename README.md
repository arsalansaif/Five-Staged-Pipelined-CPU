# Five-Staged-Pipelined-CPU

The  idea  of  the  pipelining  technique  for  building  a  fast  CPU.  The  students  will  obtain 
experience  with  the  design  implementation  and  testing  of  the  first  four  stages  (Instruction  Fetch,  Instruction 
Decode,  Instruction  Execute,  Memory)  of  the  five-stage  pipelined  CPU  using  the  Xilinx  design  package  for 
FPGAs.  It  is  assumed  that you  are  familiar  with  the  operation  of  the  Xilinx  design  package  for  Field 
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) through the Xilinix tutorial.
